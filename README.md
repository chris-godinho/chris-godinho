# Hey you.

I'm Chris, a certified full-stack web developer (EdX/University of Toronto) blending a mix of logistics, finance, and theatre into my tech journey.

From the world of banking to the dance of warehousing, I bring a robust work ethic and sharp analytical/problem-solving skills. My sweet spot? Crafting and steering web applications from start to finish.

Meeting and often surpassing goals, I'm comfortable in the lively tempo of fast-paced work settings. Ready to connect and dive into some awesome projects together!
